                  PIXEL is the premier photography club of the Institute of Aeronautical Engineering (IARE), where creativity meets technology in the most spectacular way possible.
              
                  Founded with a vision to revolutionize visual storytelling, we've created a cyberpunk haven where traditional photography techniques blend seamlessly with cutting-edge digital art forms. Our community thrives on the intersection of analog beauty and digital innovation.
                 
                  From capturing the raw essence of campus life to creating mind-bending digital masterpieces, PIXEL has become the creative powerhouse that pushes the boundaries of what's possible with a camera and imagination.
                  
                  We believe that every frame tells a story, every pixel holds potential, and every member brings a unique perspective that enriches our collective vision.
